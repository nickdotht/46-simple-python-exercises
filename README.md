### [46 Simple Python exercises](http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/python_exercises.html)

This list of exercises comprises logical operators, loops, input and output, regular expressions and more in order for people to have a basic overview of the language.

They might not be the best solutions, but I'd be glad to pull your requests.

This repository contains solutions to all 46 exercises I have solved. They're intended as a last resort in case you've tried very hard to solve a problem but you just haven't been able to figure it out.

I made sure to comment the hardest ones, or the ones that gave me some trouble.


### How to Download/Clone this project

To download this project, right from your terminal, do:

```
git clone https://github.com/R4meau/46-simple-python-exercises.git
```

or simply [click here](https://github.com/R4meau/46-simple-python-exercises/archive/master.zip) if you don't use git.

### Using Python 3?

I implemented all the solutions using Python 2.7.1 but if you're using Python 3.x most of the solutions won't work for you.
That's why I created a converter for you to convert all the solutions into Python 3. 
In the project folder you will notice this file:

- **makepython3.py** A converter that uses the 2to3 command

So all you need to do after downloading/cloning the project is

```
cd 46-simple-python-exercises
python makepython3.py
```

And it will create a folder called **exercisespy3** in the same directory. In this folder you will find all the solutions in Python 3.x.
